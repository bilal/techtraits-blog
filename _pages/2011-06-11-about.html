<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a software developer at Electronic Arts specializing in building cloud-based server infrastructure and platforms for social games. Prior to this I received my M.Math from the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I was a member of the Networks and Distributed   Systems (NDS) research group specializing in Wireless   Networks and voice over IP. I enjoy developing on a wide variety of platforms using a host of different technologies including erlang, maven, thrift and jabber. A lot of technologies I use are fairly new andÂ  lack documentation or mainstream user-base which makes it hard to google for a solution. I will use this blog as a forum to post tutorials and code snippets relating to problems that I face in my work in the hope that it will save the next person some time and effort.</p>
