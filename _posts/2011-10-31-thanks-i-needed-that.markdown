When I started writing this this blog very few people read it and fewer still chose to leave a comment. I was ok with that, the topics are sometimes esoteric and I write small how too articles for software engineers who have better things to do than writing comments on my articles. This all changed  when some botnet or got a hold of this URL and started posting spam comments. Most are badly worded and obviously fake but some spammers go to great length to make their comments seem genuine. Of coarse all spam comments are extremely flattering, even if its fake its nice to read good things about your writing. So to all spammers targeting my site, thanks. And feel free to post spam comments to this post I will event let the good ones through.
